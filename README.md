## 1. The Research Question

The first step in using statistics to address a research question is defining the question itself. The research question
is key in narrowing the scope of the research and forces a researcher to focus on something specific. After the research
question has been defined, a hypothesis can be formulated and the constraints on the data collection process will become
clearer. The research question, hypothesis, and understanding of the data that will be collected allow a researcher to 
determine the statistical tests that will be needed to analyse the data (as shown in figure 1).

#### What makes a good research question?

A good research question will focus on a single topic. It should not encompass other topics or be two questions veiled 
as one. A focussed, specific research question will allow you to get much more from your statistics. The question must 
have specific, measurable independent and dependent variables. A research question should also be useful/relevant, 
achievable, based on objective metrics, and free from any assumptions. 

#### What happens if you don't have a research question?

What happens when you don't have a specific research question, but you have data? In this situation, several techniques 
are commonly applied to draw initial insights which can then be used to generate a research question. The research 
question generated from these exploratory analyses can then be tested (using statistics) to assess whether the results 
are likely to be the occurring by chance.
