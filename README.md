# 'Analyse Your Own Data' - University of Cambridge Statistics Course

***This directory contains all the scripts and data from the above course - attended by Jack Coutts from the 15th to 
the 19th of April 2024.***

My notes from the course are contained above in the `stats_course_notes.pdf` file and represent my interpretation of the course materials.

The code in this repository has not been finalised as many of the daily course materials were not completed. These files will be cleaned up for better interpretability.
